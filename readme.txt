**Fixes ALL Google Search Console / Structured Data Testing Tool errors:**

* A value for the *headline* field is required.
* A value for the *image* field is required.
* A value for the *logo* field is required.
* A value for the *publisher* field is required.
* The *aggregateRating* field is recommended.
